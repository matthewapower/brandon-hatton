My annual letter to my clients this year compared investing to improv. It discussed the need to be fully present and the futility of thinking of the distant future because we never really know what is going to come next. I did not anticipate its relevance, because I did not anticipate the coming global pandemic.

So here we are, in the beginning of April 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is tempting to look for comparisons to the past, but they all seem incomplete. They say history repeats itself, or it rhymes, but there is no precedent for this. Pandemic of 1918? They didn't have a global economy back then. Great Depression? There was no novel scientific factor to solve for. The crash of 1987? That was one day. You get the picture. Looking to the past provides us with an interesting intellectual exercise and at times partial solutions, but it does not provide us with answers on what to do next.  

Others want to project to the future. They want to imagine a world that has restaurant tables six feet apart (a lovely thought but terrible business model), a reality where everybody works remotely, and we all use home delivery for groceries on a regular basis. Perhaps some of that is in our future, but I remember back in 2001 in the heat of the 9/11 crisis and I think about all the ways I thought the world was going to change. I was certain that we would get attacked every year or so; I was wrong. I figured mailing anthrax to your enemies would become common place; it didn’t happen. Rudy Giuliani was Time magazine’s Person of the Year and looked poised for political greatness; no, again. I figured it would really start to suck to fly on a plane; well, I got that one right. But you get the point, it is hard to invest a portfolio in a time of uncertainty and times are always uncertain.

That leaves only one thing - the present moment. The big picture question facing every investor is: How do I allocate my portfolio to stocks, bonds, cash, and other investments, and how do I adjust the allocation in real time?

You can, and should, look at the past and future for guidance when conducting fundamental research on the value of companies’ balance sheets and prospects for growth. You absolutely need to do that. But the answer to the question stands in the present moment. You need a well-defined written investment strategy that places its focus on the present moment. One that doesn't look at what you should have owned two months ago or what you may want to own two months ahead, but what you should own right now. And that decision is based on real-time data, not projections into the future. We don't know what tomorrow brings and we can’t change anything about the past.

We are here and now. And so is a worthwhile investment strategy.

Let me know how I can help.
