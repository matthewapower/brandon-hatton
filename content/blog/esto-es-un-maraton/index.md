If you were my client in 2011, you received a copy of Hector Tobar's Deep Down Dark: The Untold Stories of 33 Men Buried in a Chilean Mine, and the Miracle that Set them Free. I sent this book as a New Year’s gift because it was well-written and I found it inspiring. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would serve as a good analogy for this unprecedented modern-day quarantine.

I have returned to this book, eight years later, because the parallels to today's quarantine are too similar to ignore. You may remember the book is divided into four parts: 
	•	 Normalcy before the incident 
	•	 The time after the mine collapsed where the men were trapped with little food and hope for seventeen long days
	•	 The time where they had jubilant contact with the rescue mission above but uncertainty on how long it would take to get them out (61 days)

and finally
	•	 Life after extraction - A new normal

I sent this book as a New Year’s gift - partly because it was good writing, and partly because I found it inspiring. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would serve as a good analogy for modern quarantine times. As I re-read this book, I ponder where I am in these four stages with the current quarantine and where I perceive our society to be. 

For the miners, despite an initial run on food (not toilet paper), the men remained united and lifted each other up during the first seventeen days. It is inspiring to read. When they all felt like they couldn't take it anymore, when they were ready to give up, they heard a large boom and saw a drill from the surface break through. Watching the initial videos of these shirtless, emaciated men singing the national anthem and hugging each other brings a sense of pure unbridled joy.

It’s striking. I reflect on the juxtaposition between the great jubilation of being discovered by a drill that bore a hole almost seven football fields deep to find them, and the realization they could remain stuck in the mine for months to come waiting for the drill to create an exit large enough for everyone to get out. 

Albert W. Holland, NASA operational psychologist, advised the rescue team to prepare for "long-duration thinking." He warned the jefe in one of his first conversations after breaking through: "What comes now is going to be the hardest part." 

Likewise, positive rallies in the financial markets can trick us into thinking this current world will find our equilibrium or new normal soon. That we have been saved. Last week the financial markets had their greatest week to the upside since 1933. Unfortunately, we are not out of this yet. Markets tend to bounce around these types of bottoms for months, even testing new lows. We have yet to fully see the damage to the economy, businesses, and most importantly to our lives. It is more than likely that this is going to be a long, drawn out, and wide u-shaped recovery. And that will be the hardest part, the waiting. 

As we journey, it is important to invest wisely, adjust reasonably, and act with discipline. 

As the Chilean miners refrained, "Esto es un maratón!" This is a marathon. 

Please don't hesitate to call me with concerns or questions.
